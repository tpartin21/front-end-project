# front-end-project
This is a project I created for code Louisville.
I created a website for my mom. She is a landscape artist and needed a place to display and sell her art. On my project you will see the home page with tabs taking you to the art. I have added the hamburger menu button to switch between verticle and horizontal styles using the different media quiers for your phone or laptop. I have also incorporated a search for someone to find a specific type of landscape or at the bottom of the page you can press the button and go into the landscape types. Also from the homepage you are able to read more about my mom once you press her bio link on the home page where it will take you to a description. I hope you enjoy the site and let me know if you have further questions.
