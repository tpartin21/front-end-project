# front-end-project
This is a project I created for code Louisville.
I created a website about Chinese culture. It explains the language, history and food! I used Flexbox with three coloumns of information on Chinese culture. I also included a navigation menu to all the information for each column that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, and is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon.
